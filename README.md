Adolescent Psychological Counseling Dataset (Chinese)

This dataset is based on the efaqa-corpus-zh corpus and has been deeply optimized for the field of adolescent psychological counseling. Our main improvements include:

Corpus Refinement: Focused on adolescent psychological counseling scenarios by filtering relevant data.
Data Augmentation: Supplemented with more real-life cases to enhance coverage.
Data Cleaning: Removed noisy data to improve quality.
Data Balancing: Ensured an even distribution of different categories to prevent bias.
Spelling Correction: Fixed textual errors to optimize readability.
Finally, we have constructed a high-quality dataset specifically for adolescent psychological counseling, containing 13,084 entries, covering the following three core categories:

Worries: Involves adolescents' daily psychological distress, such as interpersonal relationships and academic pressure.
Psychological Disorders: Covers severe psychological issues that affect personal and social functioning and require professional psychological or medical intervention.
SOS Emergency Help: Identifies crises requiring immediate human intervention, such as suicidal tendencies and severe emotional breakdowns.
This dataset can be used in mental health research, natural language processing (NLP) training, intelligent counseling systems, and various other application scenarios, aiming to support adolescent mental health.
